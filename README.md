This repo accompanies my [blog post](https://jeroenpelgrims.com/access-the-firebase-auth-user-in-sveltekit-server-side/) on accessing the Firebase user in the SvelteKit backend.

To get this example running it should be enough to do the following steps:

- Clone this repo
- run `npm install`
- Create a `.env` file with the correct values.
  (Check `.env.sample` for the variables you need to set)
